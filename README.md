# About
This repository contains my Java practice projects from my first year of university.

## Term 1 - Basics
In the first term, I focused on learning the basic concepts of Java such as:
- Arrays
- Loops
- Conditionals 
- Basic methods
- Simple system outputs and user inputs

These projects are small and mainly for training and practicing these basic skills.

## Term 2 - OOP Concepts 
In the second term, I started learning about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.  
Some of the topics I practiced:
- Inheritance
- Composition
- Interfaces
- Polymorphism
- Exception Handling
- File handling 
- Simple GUI using JavaFX

Again, most of the projects here are for learning purposes. They may not be fully complete applications, but they helped with practice.

## Final Group Project - Computer Supply Store

At the end of the year, I worked with my group on a final project combining everything we learned.  
Itâ€™s a computer supply store system where users can:
- View and manage products like computers, monitors, and printers.
- Add products to the cart.
- Create new orders or cancel them.
- Save and read orders from files.

The system supports both console and GUI interaction and was fully developed using Java with OOP concepts, file handling, and exception handling.
